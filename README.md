# A Balatro modjam mod about opening presents

Participants were tasked with creating up to 5 Presents for players to unwrap from each developer's own unique container and play with across their run! Present effects can range from extremely powerful to actively detrimental, so be careful which ones you pick, as you cannot get rid of them! 

<sub>Who would throw away a gift anyways? Rude...</sub>

### Enjoy the mod, and have a happy holiday!
